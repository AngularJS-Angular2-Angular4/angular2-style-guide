## Angular 2 Style Guide

[**Official style guide**](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)

Together with the Angular core team and John Papa, we're working on an official style guide which incorporates all the best practices from:

- Practices discovered during the internal usage of Angular 2 in Google.
- The previous version of this style guide, which can [be found here](./old/README.md).
- John Papa's AngularJS 1.x and Angular 2 [style guides](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

The previous version of the style guide can be found [here](./old/README.md).
